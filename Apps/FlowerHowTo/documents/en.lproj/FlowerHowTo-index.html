        <center><strong>This application is for users of the Flutter® VRP1, respiratory therapy equipment.</strong></center>
        <hr>
        <em>This version is not yet stabilized and can be qualified as "beta". But we believe that even in its current state it has a real interest for regular users of the Flutter® VRP1. This is to get a larger number of feedbacks to enhance future releases. The source code of this software is open, and we will do our best to simplify the task of those who would participate in the development.</em>

        <ol>
            <LI>Prepare the glue pads in a roll.</LI>
            <LI>The glue paste should form a tight little room, the microphone must be isolated from the exterior.</LI>
            <LI>The microphone is a little remarquable dot in the remote controller. It should not touch the glue paste.</LI>
            <LI>Fix on the Flutter® VRP1, avoid any contact between the microphone and the surface of the Flutter®</LI>
        </ol>
        <em>The proper operations of the application depends greatly on the quality of the sound recording. There may be other attachments schemas more efficient, do not hesitate to share your experiences.</em>

        <H3>Goals and settings</H3>
        <H4>Frequencies</H4>
        <p>When you blow into the Flutter @, the metal ball it contains vibrates at a certain frequency. The frequency of exercise is between 6 and 26 Hz, depending on your experience and medical recommendations, you will have more specific goals.
        <br/>You are going to set the minimum and maximum frequencies where breathing is considered as "good".</p>
        <strong>Icon "Calibration" on the menu: <img src="CalibrationApp-Icon.png" width="57"/> </strong><br/>
        <img src="FlowerHowTo-Calibration_EN.png" width="100%" /><br/>
          
        <H4>Durations</H4>
        <p>Adjust the durations goals, the period during which the ball vibrates in the frequency interval of your choice.
        <br>The blow duration, between 1 and 20 seconds is the period of "good" Frequencies during a continous breath out.
        <br>The duration of exercise is the sum of all these "good times". When reached, the exerice is validated.
       
        <strong>Icon "Settings" ont the menu: <img src="ParametersApp-Icon.png" width="57"/> </strong><br/>
        </p>
        
        <H4>Profiles</H4>
        <p>The software allows multiple "profiles", if you want to keep differents goals depending on your physical condition or position of use. You will find them on the settings page.</p>
        
        <H3>Starting the application and exercises</h3>
        <p>The connection of headphones with a microphone start the sound analysis, the software "listens" and recognizes the characteristic noise caused by vibration of the Flutter®. A noisy environment, may confuse the software which will detected false blowings. A quiet place and a good fixation of the microphone will significantly improve the quality of the system.</p>
        <p>When the software is started, the control area at the bottom of the screen is activated.</p>
        <H4>Control Area</H4>
        <img src="FlowerHowTo-Nav-Num.png" width="100%" /><br/>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The needle</strong> indicates in real-time the vibration frequency of the Flutter®. As with the calibration, the vertical indicates the frequency goal and the white lines the frequency interval where the exercise is considered "good", at this time the needle takes the green color.</li>
            <li><strong>History</strong> represent the last blowings. The height of each bar is proportional to the total duration of a breath out. The green area is the period during which the frequency is considered "good". We get a star, when the goal is reached.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The percentage (%)</strong>is activated only when an exercise is underway, it represents the percent complete of this year compared to the target.</li>
                    <li><strong>The frequency (Hz)</strong> indicates the median frequency of the last breath out.</li>
                    <li><strong>The duration (s)</strong> gives the length of the last expiration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Menu button</strong> to return to the control page.</li>
        </ol>
        <H4>The exercises</h4>
        <p>Often associated with games, exercises are records of a series of breath out.<br/>
        To finalize one exercise (one game), you must reach the duration selected in the settings.</p>
        <h5>To start an exercise</h5>
        <p>Go to the volcano game, and start using the button on the interface. .<br/>
         <strong>Icon "Volcano Game" on the menu: <img src="VolcanoApp-Icon.png" width="57" /> </strong>
        </p>
        <p>The exercises can be started and stopped by touching the control area.</p>
        
        <H4>Results</H4>
        <strong>Icon "Results" on the menu: <img src="ResultsApp-Icon.png" width="57"/> </strong><br/>
        <p>Results are presented daily<br/>
        As an experiment, you can send this results in spresdsheet format by mail.<br/>
