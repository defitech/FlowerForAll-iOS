[ KNOWN BUGS ]
***************************************************************************************
***** THE ONLINE VERSION CRASHES *******
When headphones are plugged-in or the sound processing (thru the demo mode starts)... 
We never had this bug during the developpement, nor we can reproduce it with our own version...
It seems that in some way the binary produced for the release is not executed the same way our development binaries are.

what I grab from the console.. and crash logs:

* WHEN HEADSET PLUGGED *
The last debug send by the App is:
--- SUbsyIOS checkMicrophonePluggedIn: 0 Actual ROUTE:HeadsetInOut

* WHEN PRESSING DEMO MODE *
The last debug send by the App is:
<Warning>: actionSheet 0

I would be nice to try our iApp on a jailbraked device with the "release" package.

For now I'm working on a "deactivate RouteChangedListener" options in order to do a new release

- they must be some memory leaks.. 
- it would be nice to have an objective-c expert do some code review.. 

[ iPAD VERSION ]
- This has to be done URGENTLY before we got too much UI elements

[ DOCUMENTATION ]
- Complete "How To develop a game" document, with ergonomic guidlines and event sequence description
 

[ PARAMETERS - MONITORING MODE]
Actually the soft is design in a "target" or "goal" mode, but some people would like
to use is as a simpe monitoring device for their exercices.
For exemple an Adult, would not do "games" with it but he will be interested in having
historical statistics.
This would be easily achived by recording every blows in the database, independently 
of exerices start / stop. 
But we need to create an interface for viewing this data..

[ PARAMETERS - SETTINGS ]
- Makes profiles editables / removables .
- The model is ready to be implemented

[ COSMETICS ]
- Refactor FLOWER BREATH logo and icon

[ MONITORING ]
- Rewrite the history monitor in OpenGL 

[ MULTI USERS ]
For use in hospital or by a physiotherapist 

** The DataModel has a multi-user layer ready to be implemented
- each user has it's own directory, with it's own database
- actually the administrator (owner) account is auto created 

** Some zombie code, such as UserPicker is waiting for a nice developer
to be reused.

** multiuser should be implemented in this way:
- Only user "owner" can manage user
- User choice is proposed at start of the application if there is more
than one user in the database.
- "owner" may log as any user using it's own password, this to implement
simply a method for the administrator to consult other users data.

[ APPS MENU ]
- Placement is now manual.
  When we will have more apps, 
  (more than one page) we will have to develop an automatic placement
  for FlowerApp subclassing applications.

[ VOLCANO APPS ]
- It's nice but minimalist, 
- It would be great to have some animations and litlle blows off 

[ FLAPI - FLAPIX ]
- Is  "code spagetthi" fashionned
It would be nice to have someone exetrnal do some revieweing / refactoring

[ AUDIO FEEDBACK ]
- Add a nice audio feedback for someone who would do it's exerice without holding the iPhone.

[ SOUND PROCESSING ]
- is not perfect but functionnal..
- we will probably need to rewrite FLAPI if IAV does open their code

[ R & D ]
- Possible with a bluetooth headset ?
- Other microphone
- Make a special piece of plastic to fix the microphone to the flutter
