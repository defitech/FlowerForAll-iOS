        <h3>The Defitech foundation</h3>
        <p>Defitech foundation's mission is to help children, adolescents and young adults with disabilities using computer technology.</p>
        
        
        <p>Defitech participates in Flower-for-all breath project in order to develop a software for iPod, iPhone et iPad.</p>
        
        <h3>Flower breath - our goals</h3>
        <p>Visual feedback of Flutter® VRP1 usage on iOS (iPod, iPhone iPad)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep the work open and free, having in mind original "For-All" idea.</li>
            <li>Develop a software base for iPhone and iPod touch to do breathing exercises. Our work is intended to be reused to incorporate games and activities.</li>
            <li>Set up a system allowing patients to communicate the results of breathing exercises with their therapists</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Limitations and requests</h4>
        <P>This version is not yet stabilized and can be qualified as "beta". But we think that even in its current state it has a real interest for regular users of the Flutter® VRP1. This is to get a larger number of feedbacks to enhance future releases. The source code of this software is open, and we will do our best to simplify the task of those who would participate in the development.</p>
